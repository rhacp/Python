Challenge 

1. Write a Python program to take two numbers as input and display the result of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. 
2. Create a Python program where you increment and decrement the same variable. Display the value of the variable after each operation. 
3. Write a program to check if a number is positive or negative using logical complement operator. 
4. Write a Python program that uses both the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators in a loop to count up to 10 and then back down to 1. 
5. Create a Python program that demonstrates the use of each compound assignment operator with integers.
6. Write a Python program that takes two numbers from the user and uses relational operators to display whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number. 
7. Write a program where you perform operations between an integer and a double. Display the result. 
8. Create a program that takes two byte values, adds them together, and stores the result in a byte variable. (useless in Python)
9. Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle. Take the length and breadth as inputs. 
10. Write a program that reverses the sign of an entered integer using unary minus operator. 
11. Write a Python program that takes two boolean inputs from a user. Apply the logical negation operator (!) to each and print the result.
12. Create a program that takes an integer as input and then increments and decrements it by 1, displaying the output at each stage.
13. Write a program to calculate the price after discount. Take the original price and discount percentage as input. Use compound assignment operator to perform the calculation. 
14. Create a program that checks if a user entered number is within a specific range (e.g., 1-100). Use relational operators for the checks.
