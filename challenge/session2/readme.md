1. Write a Java program where you create two String objects named stringOne and stringTwo with the same value "OpenAI".
   Check and print whether they refer to the same object.<br />
2. Write a Java program to declare two integer variables firstNumber and secondNumber with any values. Use an equality
   operator to compare these two numbers and print the result. Do the same for two String objects firstString and
   secondString with the same value, but use the equals() method for comparison. Print the result.<br />
3. Write a Java program that declares an integer variable age with a value of 20. Print a statement saying "I am adult"
   if age is 18 or more, else print "I am not an adult".<br />
4. Write a Java program where you declare two integer variables heightOne and heightTwo with any values. Use a ternary
   operator to determine the greater height and assign it to a variable maximumHeight. Print the result.<br />
5. Write a Java program to print the numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop. As a next step, modify your program to print
   only the even numbers from 1 to 10.<br />
6. Write a Java program where you declare an integer variable temperature. Assign a value to it and print "Hot" if the
   temperature is more than 30, "Warm" if the temperature is between 20 and 30, and "Cold" if it's less than 20.<br />
7. Write a Java program that determines the type of a triangle based on its sides. Declare three variables sideOne,
   sideTwo and sideThree to represent the sides of the triangle. Use the ternary operator to determine and print whether
   the triangle is "Equilateral", "Isosceles", or "Scalene".<br />
8. Write a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number using a for loop. Declare an integer variable number and
   assign a value to it. Then calculate and print the factorial of number.<br />
9. Write a Java program to create two String variables, countryOne with the value "USA" and countryTwo with the value "
   USA". Check if countryOne and countryTwo are equal using the equals() method and print the result. Then change the
   value of countryTwo to "UK" and check for equality again. Print the result.<br />
10. Write a Java program that creates two distinct ArrayList objects, listOne and listTwo. Add some elements to listOne
    and assign listOne to listTwo. Now modify listOne by adding a new element. Print both lists and observe the
    output.<br />
11. Write a Java program where you declare four integer variables: a, b, c, and d. Assign them values of 10, 20, 30, and
    40 respectively. Create two more variables additionResult and multiplicationResult. Set additionResult to the sum of
    a and b and multiplicationResult to the product of c and d. Print the values of additionResult and
    multiplicationResult.<br />
12. Write a Java program where you declare an integer variable number with a value of 25. Use unary minus operator to
    change the sign of number and assign it to a variable negativeNumber. Print the values of number and
    negativeNumber.<br />
13. Write a Java program where you declare two boolean variables isRaining and isSunny with values of true and false,
    respectively. Use the logical complement operator to negate the values of both variables and print the new
    values.<br />
14. Write a Java program where you declare an integer variable counter with a value of 0. Use the increment operator to
    increase the value of counter by 1 and then print the value. After that, use the decrement operator to decrease the
    value of counter by 1 and then print the value.<br />
15. Write a Java program where you declare an integer variable total with a value of 100. Use the compound assignment
    operator to decrease the total by 20 and then print the value. Next, use another compound assignment operator to
    multiply the total by 2 and then print the value.<br />
16. Write a Java program where you use unary operators to perform a series of transformations on an integer variable
    number initialized to 50. First, negate number, then take the absolute value, and finally increment it by 1. Print
    the result at each step.Challenge<br />
17. Write a Java program that simulates a simple authentication system. Declare a boolean variable hasUsername and
    hasPassword. Set up a series of logical conditions using these two variables that will check the following
    conditions:<br />
    ● If both hasUsername and hasPassword are true, print "Authentication successful".<br />
    ● If either hasUsername or hasPassword is false, print "Authentication failed".<br />
    ● If hasUsername is true but hasPassword is false, print "Password is incorrect".<br />
18. Write a Java program where you declare an integer array with 5 elements. Use a for loop to initialize the array such
    that each element is equal to its index incremented by 1. Then use another for loop to decrement each element by 1.
    Print the array before and after the decrement operation using a for-each loop.<br />
18. Write a Java program that takes an integer variable age as input. Use a ternary operator to classify the person into
    one of the following categories: "Child" (age < 12), "Teenager" (age between 12 and 17), "Adult" (age between 18 and
    64), and "Senior" (age 65 and above). Print the resulting classification.<br />
19. Write a Java program that takes three integer variables a, b, and c as input. Use nested ternary operators to find
    and print the largest number among the three.<br />
20. Write a Java program that takes a double variable score representing a student’s score on a test. Use a ternary
    operator to classify the score into letter grades A, B, C, D, or F according to the following scale:<br />
    A: 90-100 <br />
    B: 80-89 <br />
    C: 70-79 <br />
    D: 60-69 <br />
    F: 0-59 <br />
    Print the resulting letter grade.
